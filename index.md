## Programming
Most of my experience is in **python**, though I have experience in C and C++ as well.  

Here is a one liner which I used on a cloud system to grab VCF information.  
```
    perl -lane 'print $F[7] if ($_ !~ /^#/)' < ${sampleprefix}.Somatic.vcf > ${sampleprefix}_INFOfield.txt
```

Other projects I have worked on are to be added in the future. Although I do not have many personal projects, I am still in the process of compiling things I have done for school.
